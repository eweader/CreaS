StateForge Licensing

StateForge is released under a dual license model. Designed to meet the requirements of different users and their needs for distribution and usage we offer StateForge under two flexible licenses. Whichever license model you choose, we are here to support you in your projects.

StateForge for open source projects

If you are developing and distributing Open Source applications under the GNU Affero General Public License (AGPL), or the GNU General Public License (GPL) then you are free to use StateForge under the GNU AGPL License, version 3. The formal terms of the AGPL can be found on the GNU website. Any software that uses code under a AGPL is itself subject to the same AGPL licensing terms.

AGPL is just like GPL, but more onerous. The GPL obligates you to distribute your own precious source code if you distribute binaries that use StateForge. The AGPL goes further, obligating you to make available to everyone your source code if you are using it on a network server for Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) or as an Application Service Provider (ASP). For example, if you are running StateForge on your server, to provide a SaaS services, you would have to give away all of your source code.

Under the AGPL, you must release the complete source code for the application that is built with StateForge, even if that application is running on a network server for SaaS purposes.

For licensing StateForge under alternate terms, so that you can use it without your own product becoming infected with the obligations of the AGPL, you should contact us to purchase a commercial license. We are also able to provide StateForge under the AGPLv3 license with a FLOSS exception.

When in doubt, keep this principle in mind: Unless you want to have all of the software you write be freely available to everyone, you should consider a commercial license. Further, if our software makes money for you, we would like to be paid too. Hence, our commercial license.
